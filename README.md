# Estimating $R_e$ and overdispersion in secondary cases from the size of identical sequence clusters of SARS-CoV-2
This repository contains the code of the statistical analysis of the paper "Estimating $R_e$ and overdispersion in secondary cases from the size of identical sequence clusters of SARS-CoV-2" by Emma Hodcroft et al. published in [PLOS Computational Biology](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012960).

## (A) Overview of content of repository
The aim of this repository is to provide everything necessary to reproduce the statistical analysis of the paper cited above. All files (R-scripts as well as data) used to obtain the results are contained in this repository. Furthermore, the complete simulated data used for the validation of the model as well as all stanfit files containing the results of the parameter estimation can be found in this repository.

## (B) How to run
* The whole R code is structured in an R-project (`R_overdispersion_cluster_size.Rproj`).
* Before running any other R file, the file `setup.R` (contained in folder `R`) needs to be run. In this file, all paths to data and results files are defined (with respect to the path of `R_overdispersion_cluster_size.Rproj`).
* R files are grouped by topic (data processing, creating plots, ...).
* Running the file `main.R` (contained in folder `R`) calls all R scripts necessary to redo the processing of data and results as well as the creation of plots and tables. Data and result files need to be stored at the paths defined in `setup.R`.
* Parameter estimation, both from simulated data and from data from Switzerland, Denmark and Germany, has been run on the high performance computing cluster of the University of Bern, UBELIX.
* Simulation of clusters for the simulation study and for the posterior predictive check have been run on the high performance computing cluster of the University of Bern, UBELIX.

## (C) Further remarks

### C.1 R package estRodis
The simulation of identical sequence clusters as well as the models to estimate parameters from the sequence cluster size distribution are implemented as functions in an R-package, called estRodis.
The estRodis package can be found here: [GitHub Martin Wohlfender: estRodis](https://github.com/mwohlfender/estRodis)

### C.2 Emma Hodcroft's sc2_k repository
The structuring of sequence data into clusters of identical sequences was done by Emma Hodcroft. Her code can be found here: [GitHub Emma Hodcroft: sc2_rk_public](https://github.com/emmahodcroft/sc2_rk_public)

### C.3 Name convention
Whenever "model five" is mentioned in comments in the code, this refers to the standard model presented in the paper. "model one", "model two", "model three", "model four" and "model six" refer to the alternative models described in the section "Sensitivity analysis" of the supplementary material of the paper "Estimating $R_e$ and overdispersion in secondary cases from the size of identical sequence clusters of SARS-CoV-2" by Emma Hodcroft et al.
